Machine Learning installs and model selections.

First install the Python module scikit-learn.  The documentation [site]{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/}.

Generate data sets of random data to compare 


The Mushroom example dataset from [Kaggle]{https://www.kaggle.com/nirajvermafcb/comparing-various-ml-models-roc-curve-comparison}] is used to evaluate common machine learning tests.

This [notebook]{https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/worker-bee-micah/ml/blob/master/00_mt_ml_catagorical_seaborn_core_build.ipynb} is a rewrite of the above mentioned kernel and mixed with code from a Pluralsight course by [Janani Ravi]{https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/seaborn-visualizing-statistical-data}. You will need to import seaborn, pandas and matplotlib to follow along. This is a good example of a dataset that does not contain any numerical columns, these Python modules make it easy to perform math on categorical data.


Paste the notebook URLs into NBviewer on the Python.org site if your browser is not rendering it properly or do not have Python installed.  Think of this as read only mode, you will not be able to interact with the cells.
